# 📄 Project Statement

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Managing basic banking operations manually can be inefficient, prone to error, and difficult to track. Beginners learning programming often struggle to understand how real-world systems like banking applications work. This project aims to create a simple and interactive console-based banking system that demonstrates real banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance checking, and viewing account details. The goal is to provide a practical, real-world application example using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## 🎯 Scope of the Project
The scope of the Bank Account Management System includes implementing a basic simulation of banking operations within a console environment. It covers:
- Account creation  
- Balance management (deposit, withdraw, check balance)  
- Displaying account details  
- Input validation and user interaction through a menu-driven interface  

The project does **not** include advanced features such as multi-user support, authentication, real-time storage, or network/database integration.

## 👥 Target Users
This project is designed for:
- **Beginner-level Java learners** who want hands-on experience in OOP concepts  
- **Students** practicing simple console-based applications  
- **Instructors** looking for a practical example to teach classes, methods, objects, and encapsulation  
- **Anyone** needing a simple demonstration of banking logic for academic submission or practice
